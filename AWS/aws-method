Aws s3 Bucket 
=============

# Method 1:
Use this google dorks for finding s3 bucket
site: http://s3.amazonaws.com <http://site.com>



# Method 2:Github Dorks

org:Target "bucket_name"
org:Target "aws_access_key"
org:Target "aws_secret_key"
org:Target "S3_BUCKET"
org:Target "S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
org:Target "S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
org:Target "S3_ENDPOINT"
org:Target "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
org:Target "list_aws_accounts"

# Method 3:
You can use many online tools which are available on GitHub to find S3 bucket of a website. I would like to list down a few of them:

1) Slurp
2) Bucket_finder
3) S3Scanner
4) Lazy S3
5) S3 Bucket Finder

# Method 4:

Use the BURP Suite and spider the target web application. BURP Spider can extract the Amazon bucket of the target web application.


# Method 5:
Right-click on any image of the target application and open image in new tab. If the image URL looks like this:
http://xyz.s3.amazonaws.com/images/b1.gif

 .Anything before ‚Äú.s3‚Äù in the URL is the bucket name of the  application


# Method 6:
Sometimes you find Amazon bucket in Content-Security-Policy Response headers
