Is the Rate Limiting enforced per-username? or per-session or IP address ?

You have to know how the rate limit is working first, if you know then its much easier to bypass it, don't hack   blindly, take your time, figure out what is being used to trigger the rate limiting, how are they identifying  and tracking request patterns???

Finally, don't ask me HOW? figure it out, that's on you to do, you called yourself a hacker, hack by practicing and figuring things out for yourself, I am still trying to figure out how to bypass h1 ..... 😜😜😜

Ok ok ok, little quiz:
I tried harris0ft1 as username (after 429 with username harris0ft) and observed that I see the normal ``Invalid username or password`` message. IS THIS SYSTEM RATE LIMIT ENFORCED PER-USERNAME OR PER-SESSION?

Simple, that's how you figure it out step by step. 
Then hack accordingly.

Rate Limit Bypass

Add the headers in the request:
X-Originating-IP: 127.0.0.1
X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
X-Remote-IP: 127.0.0.1
X-Remote-Addr: 127.0.0.1
X-Client-IP: 127.0.0.1
X-Host: 127.0.0.1
X-Forwared-Host: 127.0.0.1
X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1

Customizing HTTP Methods
If the request is GET try to change it to POST, PUT, etc.
If you wanna bypass in API's try HEAD method.

Using Null Chars
%00, %0d%0a, %09, %0C, %20, %0
For example -> while brute forcing using abc@xyz.com, and after some you get blocked
try abc@xyz.com%00

Try adding a Space Character after an Email. ( Not Encoded )

Some Common Characters 
%0d , %2e , %09 , %20 , %0, %00, %0d%0a, %0a, %0C
