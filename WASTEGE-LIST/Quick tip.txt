Title:
getting unauthorized access on 3rd party's/workspaces & and building your checklist for quickly locating bugs there via massive recon

we know that its helpful to look for google 
groups/docs/etc..

Slack as well just like when the amazing 
@h4x0r_dz
 shared days ago ..

Use google dork "site:http://join.slack.com"

so I was not in a good mode the last months to doing Google Dorks, so what I did was build a checklist ready for me & very huge one 

for EX:

http://groups.google.com
http://docs.google.com
http://join.slack.com

and here is just an example you can add more similar workspaces for your checklist 

thin I extracted all internet endpoints and as example here join[.]slack[.]com

http://otx.alienvault.com/api/v1/indicators/hostname/join.slack.com/url_list?limit=500&page=1

http://virustotal.com/vtapi/v2/domain/report?apikey=your-api&domain=join.slack.com

https://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=*.join.slack.com&fl=original&collapse=urlkey

you can use the ready tools to do it such as waymore

important note: you have to keep your checklist updated every week 

and from here I just keep looking for the company name or domain name to see if there's anything connected

and mostly the company name or domain name in the URL it self EX: tesla

https://join.slack.com/t/Tesla-Internal/shared_invite/xxxxxxxxx

Ex For Bugs found:

1 unauthorized access to the workspaces
(PII | Information disclose)
2 account takeover as Ex: valid signup employee link
3 account takeover as Ex: valid reset password employee link

now about Slack, as an example if you found an invitation link for tesla 
Tesla https://join.slack.com/t/Tesla-Internal/shared_invite/xxxxxxxxx and that link was not valid, don't stop here 
it will redirect for Ex:
tesla-internal[.]slack[.]com

here back and start looking manually for endpoints of this subdomain as well EX:

https://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=*.tesla-internal.slack.com&fl=original&collapse=urlkey

now there are a lot of 3rd party's/workspaces I just shared here 
slack & Google Docs/groups 

What I wrote is a bit long and annoying to some, so I apologize. I hope, as usual, that this will be useful to all who follow me here.
