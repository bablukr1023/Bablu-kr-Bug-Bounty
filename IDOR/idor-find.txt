$15k+ Worth of IDORs in the past couple of months; it takes a lot of manual verification, but use this regex in BurpSuite in order to filter out potential parameters:
use burpsuite

Check if the parameters are dependant on each other:

Og Request: /users?id=23&org=12
Modified: /users?id=23&org=null

Or delete the org param, basically find out which ones are necessary and try one at a time
(?i)\b\w*id\b(?!\w)\s*=\s*("[^"]*"|'[^']*'|[^&\s}]*)
