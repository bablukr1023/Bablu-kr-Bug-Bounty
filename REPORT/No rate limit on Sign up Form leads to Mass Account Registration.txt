Vulnerability Description:

The sign-up form lacks a rate-limiting mechanism, allowing unrestricted submission of registration requests. This enables automated scripts or bots to repeatedly submit the form, leading to mass account creation without any checks or delays.







Impact:

System Overload: Mass account registration can overload the server, causing performance degradation or potential downtime.





 Thank you.
