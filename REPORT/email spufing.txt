Vulnerability description:

DMARC policy helps email receiver systems distinguish legitimate and 
fraudulent emails. If an email doesn't come from an approved domain, the
 DMARC alerts the receiver systems and tells them how to 
respondâ€”isolating any potential threats.


Impact:

The most simple impact is that if there is no spoofing protection on target website, attacker can impersonate as company and send emails to users from their email. Now this could lead to many bad things like account takeover, or in case of e-banking website, capturing funds of victims, etc like that, which will degrade the reputation of the company
