 Description:
   
   HTML injection is a web vulnerability where an attacker can insert malicious or unintended HTML code into a website’s input fields (e.g., forms, comments, or URL parameters) due to improper input sanitization. Unlike Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), which involves executing JavaScript, HTML injection primarily manipulates the structure and content of a webpage by injecting HTML tags, such as <div>, <h1>, or <img>. When the injected HTML is rendered by the browser, it alters the page’s appearance or behavior, potentially deceiving users or disrupting functionality.
For example, if a comment form on a WordPress site doesn’t sanitize input, entering <h1>Warning!</h1> could render as a large heading on the page, indicating a vulnerability.




IMPACT:

The impact of HTML injection varies depending on the context but can include:
Defacement: Attackers can alter the webpage’s appearance (e.g., adding fake messages, images, or styles), damaging the site’s credibility
