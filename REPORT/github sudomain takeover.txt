 Description:
   
 The subdomain subdomain.example.com is vulnerable to a subdomain takeover due to a dangling CNAME record pointing to testing111111.azurewebsites.net, an unclaimed resource on Microsoft Azure. By registering the resource testing111111 on Azure, I was able to claim control of the subdomain and serve arbitrary content. A proof-of-concept (PoC) page was hosted at subdomain.example.com/poc-2bdg3erf2i6td.html, demonstrating full control over the subdomain without requiring ownership verification. This vulnerability arises because the DNS record was not removed after the associated third-party service was decommissioned.





IMPACT:

This subdomain takeover allows an attacker to:
Host Malicious Content: Serve phishing pages, fake login forms, or malware, potentially tricking users into disclosing sensitive information (e.g., credentials, personal data).
