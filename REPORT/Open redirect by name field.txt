Vulnerability Description:

The website allows users to input a value (e.g., "evil.com") in the name field request.
This input is reflected in the reset password email and link (e.g., the link redirects to "evil.com" instead of a legitimate domain).





Impact:

Security Risk: An attacker could manipulate the input to redirect users to malicious websites (e.g., phishing pages or sites hosting malware), potentially leading to credential theft or data compromise.
User Trust: Unintended redirects can confuse or mislead users, damaging the website's credibility.
