Vulnerability Description:

The absence of rate limiting on the password reset functionality allows an attacker to send unlimited password reset requests for a target email or user account without any restrictions. Typically, when a user initiates a "Forgot Password" request, the system sends a reset link or OTP to the associated email or phone number. Without rate limiting, an attacker can flood the system with repeated requests for the same account, causing the system to process and send multiple reset emails or tokens without any cap. This vulnerability is common in web applications where authentication endpoints, like password reset, lack proper rate-limiting controls.






Impact:

Email Flooding/Spamming: An attacker can overwhelm a user's email inbox with numerous password reset emails, causing annoyance, harassment, or potential email server overload. This may also lead to the email provider flagging the service as spam.
