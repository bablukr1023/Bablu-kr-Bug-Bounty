Vulnerability description:

The current password policy for the system/application (e.g., example.com or specify the platform) is insufficiently strict, allowing users to set weak passwords (e.g., short length, no complexity requirements). This vulnerability increases the risk of unauthorized access through brute force attacks, password guessing, or credential stuffing, potentially compromising user accounts and sensitive data..


Impact:

Hackers can easily break into accounts or systems, gaining access to sensitive information like personal data, financial details, or private communications
